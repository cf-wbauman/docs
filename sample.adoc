== A Sample Header

Let's put some text here. And maybe some bullet points:

* point one
* point two
* point three
* point four

NOTE: The sample note goes here.

The YAML syntax below:

[source,yaml]
----
toplevel:
  node:
    leaf: foobar
    value: 1234
----

=== Section Header

And again, some text here.

And now a table:

[cols="2,2,2"]
|===
| *Column 1* | *Column 2* | *Column 3*
| cell 1.1   | cell 1.2   | cell 1.3
| cell 2.1   | cell 2.2   | cell 2.3
| cell 3.1   | cell 3.2   | cell 3.3
| cell 4.1   | cell 4.2   | cell 4.3
| cell 5.1   | cell 5.2   | cell 5.3
|===

And some more text here.
